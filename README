The purpose of the postfix.cpp program is to perform a postifx calculation given a postfix expression.
This program inputs:
	Expression: takes an input expression from the user.
	Y: run the program one more time
	N: ends the calculator program
This program outputs:
	The sequence and process of calculating the expression before pushing an answer after a semicolon

This program uses:
iostream, string, "stack.h", vector, limits, cstdlib, "sexceptions.h" 
	where stack.h and sexceptions are local files that include the necessary building blocks of the stack
	necessary exceptions to check for errors.
Outline:
	The code uses a for loop to parse the information before using a stack to store information. As operators
	are traversed, numbers are extracted and worked on before being put back into the stack. This is repeated until
	there is no other evaluation left.

The goal of the myBet.cpp program is to perform a infix to prefix operation on a given mathematical funciton.
this program inputs:
	No user input
outputs:
	The prefix notation of the given file of mathematical functions.
This program uses:
iostream, string, "stack.h", vector, fstream, "sexceptions.h"
	where sexceptions and stack are local files used just like the postfix class
Outline:
	the code uses a for loop to parse through a string representing a mathematical function before converting it to
	postfix notation, then a BET, and finally a prefix notation is printed.
